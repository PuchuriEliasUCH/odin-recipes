      <h2>beef empanada recipe</h2>
      <p>
        Oh am I excited to share how to make empanadas with you! And boy do I have a lot to share, because what is
        better than savory goodness encased in pastry that you don’t even need a fork and knife to eat?
      </p>

      <p>
        This beef empanada recipe is made with Goya Discos pastry rounds and a mouthwatering filling of seasoned ground
        beef, tomatoes, onions, and garlic. Enjoy these flaky, deep-fried empanadas as an appetizer, a main dish, or
        even after your main course.

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef; cook and stir until browned and
          crumbly, about 10 minutes. Add onions and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomato sauce, olives,
          sofrito, sazón, garlic, oregano, and pepper. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until mixture thickens,
          about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Roll empanada disks on a lightly floured surface until 1/2 inch larger in diameter. Spoon about 1 tablespoon
          meat mixture into the middle of each disk. Moisten the disk edges with water, fold in half over filling to
          form a half-moon, and pinch to seal (or seal with a fork).</li>
        <li>Heat 2 1/2 inches corn oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Working in
          batches, fry empanadas until crisp and golden brown, flipping once, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer to paper towels
          to drain.</li>
